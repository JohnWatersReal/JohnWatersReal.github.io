## Things to do:
### On my code:
- Fix the build so it deploys the artifact
- Change the file 'Crossword.ipuz' so it's not named 'Crossword.ipuz'
- Add mini support
- Make it look prettier

### On the code I have stolen from Frozen Pandaman
- Make it so you can't delete revealed characters
- Maybe add swiping support on mobile 
- Maybe a back to menu option in the crossword page
