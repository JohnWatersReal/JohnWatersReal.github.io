## Things to do:
### On my code:
- Fix the build so it deploys the artifact
- Change the file 'Crossword.ipuz' so it's not named 'Crossword.ipuz'
- Add mini support
- Make it look prettier
- Add logout button
- Double check security
- Add a 'latest' tab


### On the code I have stolen from Frozen Pandaman
- Maybe add swiping support on mobile 
- Maybe a back to menu option in the crossword page
- Make it so if the grid is filled incorrectly, a toast informing you that something is wrong shows up
- Make it so circles don't overlap with numbers
